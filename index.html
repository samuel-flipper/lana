        <h2>Beginnings of AI (1940s–1950s)</h2>

        <p>
            The concept of artificial intelligence dates back to the 1940s, when early computer scientists began wondering whether machines could "think". 
            Alan Turing’s 1950 paper, <em>"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"</em>, posed the famous question: 
            <strong>“Can machines think?”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            During this era, simple neural networks and symbolic reasoning systems were first explored — setting the foundation for decades of innovation.

        <h2>The Golden Age (1956–1970s)</h2>
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/900x400?robot" alt="Early AI research">
        <p>
            The term "Artificial Intelligence" was officially coined at the <strong>Dartmouth Conference in 1956</strong>, marking the birth of AI as a field of study. 
            Early programs like the Logic Theorist and ELIZA demonstrated that computers could mimic aspects of human reasoning and conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Researchers were optimistic — predicting that human-level AI was only a few decades away.

        <h2>AI Winters (1970s–1990s)</h2>
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/900x400?frozen" alt="AI Winter concept">
        <p>
            Progress slowed during the so-called "AI Winters", as funding and interest declined. 
            Many early promises had not been fulfilled, and computers of the time lacked the power and data to make AI truly practical.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite this, progress continued quietly in specialized areas like expert systems, robotics, and computer vision.

        <h2>The Rise of Modern AI (2000s–Present)</h2>
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/900x400?artificial-intelligence" alt="Modern AI">
        <p>
            The explosion of data, advances in hardware, and breakthroughs in deep learning reignited AI research. 
            Algorithms such as convolutional neural networks began outperforming humans in image recognition, language translation, and strategic games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technologies like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>AlphaGo</strong>, and <strong>DALL·E</strong> have transformed how humans interact with machines — making AI a central force in modern innovation.

        <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/900x400?future-technology" alt="Future AI concept">
        <p>
            As AI continues to evolve, it raises deep questions about ethics, consciousness, and the limits of human creativity. 
            From autonomous systems to personal assistants, AI is poised to shape nearly every aspect of society.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story of AI is far from over — it’s only just beginning.
